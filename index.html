            <p class="paragraph">Hey Hey! Do you see that girl doing those quirky dance moves, the one in the white dress? Yep, you guessed it, that’s me – Shivani. Hello, everyone! Here’s my story!<br><br>
              Currently, I'm navigating through the University of Waterloo studying Global Business & Digital Arts. But I'm not just defined by my academics, there’s more to me than that. I am an energetic, dynamic, determined and adventurous person all geared towards venturing into the captivating world of digital media.
              One morning during the pandemic, you know when everyone was locked in their homes,  I found myself staring out the window, contemplating who I am and where my passions lie. As a high school senior, the prospect of choosing a path took over me and so I was lost. But when encouraged by my parents to explore diverse fields, I took their advice to heart,  taking it  one step and one day at a time.
              Embracing the idea that our minds function like parachutes – at their best when open – I  expanded into various activities. From joining STEM clubs to engaging in peer tutoring and even participating in a hackathon, I gradually found a passion for creativity, collaboration, and innovation. It was during those hackathons, where I got the chance to explore the realms of UI/UX designing and guess what, you know it, I fell in love with it. I was thinking beyond imagination about this field, day and night, what I can do and how I can grow and that was the spark that ignited my journey. <br><br> So there you have it folks, this is my journey so far and I know that there’s more coming soon. <br> Stay Tuned, but ADIÓS for now!
